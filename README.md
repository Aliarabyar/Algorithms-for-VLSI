**ALGORITHMS FOR VLSI**

**SPECTRAL GRAPH DRAWING**


Graph theory is used in many fields of studies and because of the wide range of its uses, each
discovery in this field can have a significant societal influence. A graph drawing, also known as a
network diagram, is a visual representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. We know that the
same graph can have several alternative layouts. All that concerns is which vertices are connected by
edges. The way these vertices and edges are arranged in a drawing has an impact on its readability,
utility, fabrication cost, and aesthetic.
In this project, the method called spectral method is used which is a class of algorithm for drawing
graphs. Two classes of algorithms for drawing graphs will be discussed in this report. Spectral and
Force-directed graph drawing algorithm.
